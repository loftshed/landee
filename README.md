An object-oriented programming game project produced as part of the Concordia Bootcamps Full-Stack Web Development program. This came along pretty early in the program, 24 days after I had laid eyes on VScode for the first time in my life - so, the gameplay isn't exactly thrilling, but I had a lot of fun with the visuals.
